# Fail2ban plugin for traefik

[![Build Status](https://github.com/tomMoulard/fail2ban/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tomMoulard/fail2ban/actions/workflows/main.yml)

This plugin is an implementation of the fail2ban mechanism as a middleware
plugin for Traefik.

## Configuration

### Whitelist
You can whitelist some IP using this:
```yml
testData:
  whitelist:
    files:
      - "tests/test-ipfile.txt"
    ip:
      - "::1"
      - "127.0.0.1"
```

Where you can use some IP in an array of files or directly in the
configuration.

### Blacklist
Like whitelist, you can blacklist some IP using this:
```yml
testData:
  blacklist:
    files:
      - "tests/test-ipfile.txt"
    ip:
      - "::1"
      - "127.0.0.1"
```

Where you can use some IP in an array of files or directly in the
configuration.


## Fail2ban
We plan to use all default fail2ban configuration but at this time only a
few features are implemented:
```yml
testData:
  rules:
    urlregexps:
    - regexp: "/no"
      mode: block
    - regexp: "/yes"
      mode: allow
    bantime: "3h"
    findtime: "10m"
    maxretry: 4
    enabled: true
```

Where:
 - `findtime`: is the time slot used to count requests (if there is too many
requests with the same ip in this slot of time, the ip goes into ban). You can
use 'smart' strings: "4h", "2m", "1s", ...
 - `bantime`: correspond to the amount of time the IP is in Ban mode.
 - `maxretry`: number of request before Ban mode.
 - `enabled`: allow to enable or disable the plugin (must be set to `true` to
enable the plugin).
 - `urlregexp`: a regexp list to block / allow requests with regexps on the url

#### URL Regexp
Urlregexp are used to defined witch part of your website will be either
allowed, blocked or filtered :
- allow : all requests where the url match the regexp will be forwarded to the
backend without any check
- block : all requests where the url match the regexp will be stopped

##### No definitions

```yml
testData:
  rules:
    bantime: "3h"
    findtime: "10m"
    maxretry: 4
    enabled: true
```

By default, fail2ban will be applied.

##### Multiple definition

```yml
testData:
  rules:
    urlregexps:
    - regexp: "/whoami"
      mode: allow
    - regexp: "/do-not-access"
      mode: block
    bantime: "3h"
    findtime: "10m"
    maxretry: 4
    enabled: true
```

In the case where you define multiple regexp on the same url, the order of
process will be :
1. Block
2. Allow

In this example, all requests to `/do-not-access` will be denied and all
requests to `/whoami` will be allowed without any fail2ban interaction.

#### Schema
First request, IP is added to the Pool, and the `findtime` timer is started:
```
A |------------->
  ↑
```

Second request, `findtime` is not yet finished thus the request is fine:
```
A |--x---------->
     ↑
```

Third request, `maxretry` is now full, this request is fine but the next wont.
```
A |--x--x------->
        ↑
```

Fourth request, too bad, now it's jail time, next request will go through after
`bantime`:
```
A |--x--x--x---->
           ↓
B          |------------->
```

Fifth request, the IP is in Ban mode, nothing happen:
```
A |--x--x--x---->
B          |--x---------->
              ↑
```

Last request, the `bantime` is now over, another `findtime` is started:
```
A |--x--x--x---->            |------------->
                             ↑
B          |--x---------->
```

## How to dev

```bash
$ docker compose up
```
