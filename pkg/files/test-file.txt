DESCRIPTION
       man is the system's manual pager.  Each page argument given to man  is  nor‐
       mally  the  name of a program, utility or function.  The manual page associ‐
       ated with each of these arguments is then found and displayed.   A  section,
       if  provided,  will  direct  man to look only in that section of the manual.
       The default action is to search in all of the available sections following a
       pre-defined  order ("1 n l 8 3 2 3posix 3pm 3perl 3am 5 4 9 6 7" by default,
       unless overridden by the SECTION directive in /etc/manpath.config),  and  to
       show only the first page found, even if page exists in several sections.

       The  table  below  shows  the  section numbers of the manual followed by the
       types of pages they contain.

       1   Executable programs or shell commands
       2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
       3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
       4   Special files (usually found in /dev)
       5   File formats and conventions eg /etc/passwd
       6   Games
       7   Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions),  e.g.  man(7),
           groff(7)
       8   System administration commands (usually only for root)
       9   Kernel routines [Non standard]

       A manual page consists of several sections.

       Conventional  section  names include NAME, SYNOPSIS, CONFIGURATION, DESCRIP‐
       TION, OPTIONS, EXIT STATUS, RETURN VALUE, ERRORS, ENVIRONMENT,  FILES,  VER‐
       SIONS, CONFORMING TO, NOTES, BUGS, EXAMPLE, AUTHORS, and SEE ALSO.

       The following conventions apply to the SYNOPSIS section and can be used as a
       guide in other sections.

       bold text          type exactly as shown.
       italic text        replace with appropriate argument.
       [-abc]             any or all arguments within [ ] are optional.
       -a|-b              options delimited by | cannot be used together.
       argument ...       argument is repeatable.
       [expression] ...   entire expression within [ ] is repeatable.

       Exact rendering may vary depending on the output device.  For instance,  man
       will  usually  not be able to render italics when running in a terminal, and
       will typically use underlined or coloured text instead.

       The command or function illustration is a pattern that should match all pos‐
       sible  invocations.  In some cases it is advisable to illustrate several ex‐
       clusive invocations as is shown in the SYNOPSIS section of this manual page.

EXAMPLES
       man ls
           Display the manual page for the item (program) ls.

       man man.7
           Display the manual page for macro package man from section 7.

       man -a intro
           Display, in succession, all of the available  intro  manual  pages  con‐
           tained  within  the  manual.   It is possible to quit between successive
           displays or skip any of them.

       man -t alias | lpr -Pps
           Format the manual page referenced by `alias',  usually  a  shell  manual
           page,  into the default troff or groff format and pipe it to the printer
           named ps.  The default output for  groff  is  usually  PostScript.   man
           --help should advise as to which processor is bound to the -t option.

       man -l -Tdvi ./foo.1x.gz > ./foo.1x.dvi
           This  command  will  decompress  and format the nroff source manual page
           ./foo.1x.gz into a device independent (dvi) file.   The  redirection  is
           necessary  as the -T flag causes output to be directed to stdout with no
           pager.  The output could be viewed with a program such as xdvi  or  fur‐
           ther processed into PostScript using a program such as dvips.

       man -k printf
           Search  the  short  descriptions  and  manual page names for the keyword
           printf as regular expression.  Print out  any  matches.   Equivalent  to
           apropos printf.

       man -f smail
           Lookup  the manual pages referenced by smail and print out the short de‐
           scriptions of any found.  Equivalent to whatis smail.

OVERVIEW
       Many options are available to man in order to give as  much  flexibility  as
       possible  to  the user.  Changes can be made to the search path, section or‐
       der, output processor, and other behaviours and operations detailed below.

       If set, various environment variables are interrogated to determine the  op‐
       eration  of  man.  It is possible to set the `catch all' variable $MANOPT to
       any string in command line format with the exception that any spaces used as
       part of an option's argument must be escaped (preceded by a backslash).  man
       will parse $MANOPT prior to parsing its own command line.  Those options re‐
       quiring an argument will be overridden by the same options found on the com‐
       mand line.  To reset all of the options set in $MANOPT, -D can be  specified
       as  the  initial command line option.  This will allow man to `forget' about
       the options specified in $MANOPT although they must still have been valid.

       The manual pager utilities packaged as man-db make extensive  use  of  index
       database caches.  These caches contain information such as where each manual
       page can be found on the filesystem and what its whatis (short one line  de‐
       scription  of the man page) contains, and allow man to run faster than if it
       had to search the filesystem each time to find the appropriate manual  page.
       If  requested  using  the  -u option, man will ensure that the caches remain
       consistent, which can obviate the need to manually run  software  to  update
       traditional whatis text databases.

       If  man cannot find a mandb initiated index database for a particular manual
       page hierarchy, it will still search for the  requested  manual  pages,  al‐
       though  file globbing will be necessary to search within that hierarchy.  If
       whatis or apropos fails to find an index it will try to extract  information
       from a traditional whatis database instead.

       These  utilities  support  compressed source nroff files having, by default,
       the extensions of .Z, .z and .gz.  It is possible to deal with any  compres‐
       sion  extension,  but this information must be known at compile time.  Also,
       by default, any cat pages produced are compressed using gzip.  Each `global'
       manual  page hierarchy such as /usr/share/man or /usr/X11R6/man may have any
       directory as its cat page hierarchy.  Traditionally the cat pages are stored
       under  the  same  hierarchy  as the man pages, but for reasons such as those
       specified in the File Hierarchy Standard (FHS), it may be  better  to  store
       them elsewhere.  For details on how to do this, please read manpath(5).  For
       details on why to do this, read the standard.

       International support is available with this package.  Native language  man‐
       ual  pages  are  accessible  (if available on your system) via use of locale
       functions.  To activate such support, it is necessary to set either $LC_MES‐
       SAGES,  $LANG  or another system dependent environment variable to your lan‐
       guage locale, usually specified in the POSIX 1003.1 based format:

       <language>[_<territory>[.<character-set>[,<version>]]]

       If the desired page is available in your locale, it  will  be  displayed  in
       lieu of the standard (usually American English) page.

       Support  for international message catalogues is also featured in this pack‐
       age and can be activated in the same way, again if available.  If  you  find
       that  the manual pages and message catalogues supplied with this package are
       not available in your native language and you would  like  to  supply  them,
       please contact the maintainer who will be coordinating such activity.

       For  information regarding other features and extensions available with this
       manual pager, please read the documents supplied with the package.

DEFAULTS
       man will search for the desired  manual  pages  within  the  index  database
       caches. If the -u option is given, a cache consistency check is performed to
       ensure the databases accurately reflect the filesystem.  If this  option  is
       always  given,  it  is not generally necessary to run mandb after the caches
       are initially created, unless a cache becomes corrupt.  However,  the  cache
       consistency  check  can be slow on systems with many manual pages installed,
       so it is not performed by default, and system administrators may wish to run
       mandb  every  week  or  so  to keep the database caches fresh.  To forestall
       problems caused by outdated caches, man will fall back to file globbing if a
       cache lookup fails, just as it would if no cache was present.

       Once  a  manual page has been located, a check is performed to find out if a
       relative preformatted `cat' file already exists and is newer than the  nroff
       file.   If  it does and is, this preformatted file is (usually) decompressed
       and then displayed, via use of a pager.  The pager can  be  specified  in  a
       number  of  ways, or else will fall back to a default is used (see option -P
       for details).  If no cat is found or is older than the nroff file, the nroff
       is filtered through various programs and is shown immediately.

       If  a  cat file can be produced (a relative cat directory exists and has ap‐
       propriate permissions), man will compress and store  the  cat  file  in  the
       background.

       The  filters are deciphered by a number of means.  Firstly, the command line
       option -p or the environment variable $MANROFFSEQ is  interrogated.   If  -p
       was  not  used and the environment variable was not set, the initial line of
       the nroff file is parsed for a preprocessor string.  To contain a valid pre‐
       processor string, the first line must resemble

       '\" <string>

       where string can be any combination of letters described by option -p below.

       If  none  of the above methods provide any filter information, a default set
       is used.

       A formatting pipeline is formed from the filters and the  primary  formatter
       (nroff  or  [tg]roff with -t) and executed.  Alternatively, if an executable
       program mandb_nfmt (or mandb_tfmt with -t) exists in the man tree  root,  it
       is  executed instead.  It gets passed the manual source file, the preproces‐
       sor string, and optionally the device specified with -T or -E as arguments.

OPTIONS
       Non argument options that are duplicated either  on  the  command  line,  in
       $MANOPT,  or  both,  are not harmful.  For options that require an argument,
       each duplication will override the previous argument value.

   General options
       -C file, --config-file=file
              Use this user configuration file rather than the default  of  ~/.man‐
              path.

       -d, --debug
              Print debugging information.

       -D, --default
              This  option  is  normally issued as the very first option and resets
              man's behaviour to its default.  Its use is to  reset  those  options
              that  may  have been set in $MANOPT.  Any options that follow -D will
              have their usual effect.

       --warnings[=warnings]
              Enable warnings from groff.  This  may  be  used  to  perform  sanity
              checks on the source text of manual pages.  warnings is a comma-sepa‐
              rated list of warning names; if it is not supplied,  the  default  is
              "mac".  See the “Warnings” node in info groff for a list of available
              warning names.

   Main modes of operation
       -f, --whatis
              Equivalent to whatis.  Display a short description  from  the  manual
              page, if available.  See whatis(1) for details.

       -k, --apropos
              Equivalent to apropos.  Search the short manual page descriptions for
              keywords and display any matches.  See apropos(1) for details.

       -K, --global-apropos
              Search for text in all manual pages.  This is a  brute-force  search,
              and  is  likely  to  take some time; if you can, you should specify a
              section to reduce the number of  pages  that  need  to  be  searched.
              Search  terms may be simple strings (the default), or regular expres‐
              sions if the --regex option is used.

              Note that this searches the sources of the manual pages, not the ren‐
              dered  text,  and  so  may include false positives due to things like
              comments in source files.  Searching the rendered text would be  much
              slower.

       -l, --local-file
              Activate `local' mode.  Format and display local manual files instead
              of searching through the system's  manual  collection.   Each  manual
              page argument will be interpreted as an nroff source file in the cor‐
              rect format.  No cat file is produced.  If '-' is listed  as  one  of
              the  arguments,  input will be taken from stdin.  When this option is
              not used, and man fails to find the page required, before  displaying
              the error message, it attempts to act as if this option was supplied,
              using the name as a filename and looking for an exact match.

       -w, --where, --path, --location
              Don't actually display the manual pages, but do print the location(s)
              of the source nroff files that would be formatted.

       -W, --where-cat, --location-cat
              Don't actually display the manual pages, but do print the location(s)
              of the cat files that would be displayed.  If  -w  and  -W  are  both
              specified, print both separated by a space.

       -c, --catman
              This  option  is  not  for general use and should only be used by the
              catman program.

       -R encoding, --recode=encoding
              Instead of formatting the manual page in the usual  way,  output  its
              source  converted to the specified encoding.  If you already know the
              encoding of the source file, you can also  use  manconv(1)  directly.
              However,  this option allows you to convert several manual pages to a
              single encoding without having to explicitly state  the  encoding  of
              each,  provided that they were already installed in a structure simi‐
              lar to a manual page hierarchy.

   Finding manual pages
       -L locale, --locale=locale
              man will normally determine your current locale by a call  to  the  C
              function  setlocale(3)  which  interrogates various environment vari‐
              ables, possibly including $LC_MESSAGES  and  $LANG.   To  temporarily
              override  the  determined  value,  use this option to supply a locale
              string directly to man.  Note that it will not take effect until  the
              search  for  pages  actually begins.  Output such as the help message
              will always be displayed in the initially determined locale.

       -m system[,...], --systems=system[,...]
              If this system has access to other operating system's  manual  pages,
              they  can be accessed using this option.  To search for a manual page
              from NewOS's manual page collection, use the option -m NewOS.

              The system specified can be a combination of comma delimited  operat‐
              ing  system  names.  To include a search of the native operating sys‐
              tem's manual pages, include the  system  name  man  in  the  argument
              string.  This option will override the $SYSTEM environment variable.

       -M path, --manpath=path
              Specify  an  alternate  manpath to use.  By default, man uses manpath
              derived code to determine the path to search.  This option  overrides
              the $MANPATH environment variable and causes option -m to be ignored.

              A path specified as a manpath must be the root of a manual page hier‐
              archy structured into sections as described in the man-db manual (un‐
              der "The manual page system").  To view manual pages outside such hi‐
              erarchies, see the -l option.

       -S list, -s list, --sections=list
              List is a colon- or comma-separated list of `order  specific'  manual
              sections  to  search.  This option overrides the $MANSECT environment
              variable.  (The -s spelling is for compatibility with System V.)

       -e sub-extension, --extension=sub-extension
              Some systems incorporate large packages  of  manual  pages,  such  as
              those that accompany the Tcl package, into the main manual page hier‐
              archy.  To get around the problem of having two manual pages with the
              same name such as exit(3), the Tcl pages were usually all assigned to
              section l.  As this is unfortunate, it is now  possible  to  put  the
              pages in the correct section, and to assign a specific `extension' to
              them, in this case, exit(3tcl).  Under  normal  operation,  man  will
              display exit(3) in preference to exit(3tcl).  To negotiate this situ‐
              ation and to avoid having to know which section the page you  require
              resides in, it is now possible to give man a sub-extension string in‐
              dicating which package the page must belong to.  Using the above  ex‐
              ample, supplying the option -e tcl to man will restrict the search to
              pages having an extension of *tcl.

       -i, --ignore-case
              Ignore case when searching for manual pages.  This is the default.

       -I, --match-case
              Search for manual pages case-sensitively.

       --regex
              Show all pages with any part of either their names or their  descrip‐
              tions  matching  each  page argument as a regular expression, as with
              apropos(1).  Since there is usually  no  reasonable  way  to  pick  a
              "best"  page when searching for a regular expression, this option im‐
              plies -a.

       --wildcard
              Show all pages with any part of either their names or their  descrip‐
              tions  matching  each  page  argument using shell-style wildcards, as
              with apropos(1) --wildcard.  The page argument must match the  entire
              name  or description, or match on word boundaries in the description.
              Since there is usually no reasonable way to pick a "best"  page  when
              searching for a wildcard, this option implies -a.

       --names-only
              If  the  --regex or --wildcard option is used, match only page names,
              not page descriptions, as with whatis(1).  Otherwise, no effect.

       -a, --all
              By default, man will exit after displaying the most  suitable  manual
              page  it finds.  Using this option forces man to display all the man‐
              ual pages with names that match the search criteria.

       -u, --update
              This option causes man to perform an `inode level' consistency  check
              on  its database caches to ensure that they are an accurate represen‐
              tation of the filesystem.  It will only have a useful effect  if  man
              is installed with the setuid bit set.

       --no-subpages
              By  default,  man  will  try  to interpret pairs of manual page names
              given on the command line as equivalent to a single manual page  name
              containing  a hyphen or an underscore.  This supports the common pat‐
              tern of programs that implement a  number  of  subcommands,  allowing
              them to provide manual pages for each that can be accessed using sim‐
              ilar syntax as would be used to invoke  the  subcommands  themselves.
              For example:

                $ man -aw git diff
                /usr/share/man/man1/git-diff.1.gz

              To disable this behaviour, use the --no-subpages option.

                $ man -aw --no-subpages git diff

   Controlling formatted output
       -P pager, --pager=pager
              Specify which output pager to use.  By default, man uses pager, fall‐
              ing back to cat if pager is not found or is not executable.  This op‐
              tion  overrides  the  $MANPAGER  environment  variable, which in turn
              overrides the $PAGER environment variable.  It is not  used  in  con‐
              junction with -f or -k.

              The  value  may be a simple command name or a command with arguments,
              and may use shell quoting  (backslashes,  single  quotes,  or  double
              quotes).   It  may not use pipes to connect multiple commands; if you
              need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the file  to  display
              either as an argument or on standard input.

       -r prompt, --prompt=prompt
              If a recent version of less is used as the pager, man will attempt to
              set its prompt and some sensible options.  The default  prompt  looks
              like

               Manual page name(sec) line x

              where  name  denotes the manual page name, sec denotes the section it
              was found under and x the current line number.  This is  achieved  by
              using the $LESS environment variable.

              Supplying  -r  with  a string will override this default.  The string
              may contain the text $MAN_PN which will be expanded to  the  name  of
              the  current  manual  page and its section name surrounded by `(' and
              `)'.  The string used to produce the default could be expressed as

              \ Manual\ page\ \$MAN_PN\ ?ltline\ %lt?L/%L.:
              byte\ %bB?s/%s..?\ (END):?pB\ %pB\\%..
              (press h for help or q to quit)

              It is broken into three lines here for the sake of readability  only.
              For  its  meaning  see the less(1) manual page.  The prompt string is
              first evaluated by the shell.  All  double  quotes,  back-quotes  and
              backslashes  in  the prompt must be escaped by a preceding backslash.
              The prompt string may end in an escaped $ which may  be  followed  by
              further options for less.  By default man sets the -ix8 options.

              The  $MANLESS environment variable described below may be used to set
              a default prompt string if none is supplied on the command line.

       -7, --ascii
              When viewing a pure ascii(7) manual page on a 7 bit terminal or  ter‐
              minal  emulator, some characters may not display correctly when using
              the latin1(7) device description with GNU nroff.  This option  allows
              pure  ascii manual pages to be displayed in ascii with the latin1 de‐
              vice.  It will not translate any latin1 text.   The  following  table
              shows  the  translations performed: some parts of it may only be dis‐
              played properly when using GNU nroff's latin1(7) device.

              Description        Octal   latin1   ascii
              ──────────────────────────────────────────
              continuation hy‐    255      ‐        -
              phen
              bullet (middle      267      •        o
              dot)
              acute accent        264      ´        '
              multiplication      327      ×        x
              sign

              If  the latin1 column displays correctly, your terminal may be set up
              for latin1 characters and this  option  is  not  necessary.   If  the
              latin1 and ascii columns are identical, you are reading this page us‐
              ing this option or man did not format this page using the latin1  de‐
              vice  description.   If  the latin1 column is missing or corrupt, you
              may need to view manual pages with this option.

              This option is ignored when using options -t, -H, -T, or -Z  and  may
              be useless for nroff other than GNU's.

       -E encoding, --encoding=encoding
              Generate output for a character encoding other than the default.  For
              backward compatibility, encoding may  be  an  nroff  device  such  as
              ascii,  latin1,  or utf8 as well as a true character encoding such as
              UTF-8.

       --no-hyphenation, --nh
              Normally, nroff will automatically hyphenate text at line breaks even
              in  words that do not contain hyphens, if it is necessary to do so to
              lay out words on a line without excessive spacing.  This option  dis‐
              ables automatic hyphenation, so words will only be hyphenated if they
              already contain hyphens.

              If you are writing a manual page and simply  want  to  prevent  nroff
              from  hyphenating  a  word at an inappropriate point, do not use this
              option, but consult the nroff documentation  instead;  for  instance,
              you  can put "\%" inside a word to indicate that it may be hyphenated
              at that point, or put "\%" at the start of a word to prevent it  from
              being hyphenated.

       --no-justification, --nj
              Normally,  nroff  will  automatically  justify  text to both margins.
              This option disables full justification, leaving  justified  only  to
              the left margin, sometimes called "ragged-right" text.

              If  you  are  writing  a manual page and simply want to prevent nroff
              from justifying certain paragraphs, do not use this option, but  con‐
              sult  the  nroff documentation instead; for instance, you can use the
              ".na", ".nf", ".fi", and ".ad" requests to  temporarily  disable  ad‐
              justing and filling.

       -p string, --preprocessor=string
              Specify  the  sequence  of  preprocessors  to  run  before  nroff  or
              troff/groff.  Not all installations will have  a  full  set  of  pre‐
              processors.  Some of the preprocessors and the letters used to desig‐
              nate them are: eqn (e), grap (g), pic (p), tbl (t), vgrind (v), refer
              (r).   This  option  overrides  the $MANROFFSEQ environment variable.
              zsoelim is always run as the very first preprocessor.

       -t, --troff
              Use groff -mandoc to format the manual page to stdout.   This  option
              is not required in conjunction with -H, -T, or -Z.

       -T[device], --troff-device[=device]
              This  option  is used to change groff (or possibly troff's) output to
              be suitable for a device other than the default.  It implies -t.  Ex‐
              amples  (provided with Groff-1.17) include dvi, latin1, ps, utf8, X75
              and X100.

       -H[browser], --html[=browser]
              This option will cause groff to produce HTML output, and will display
              that output in a web browser.  The choice of browser is determined by
              the optional browser argument if one is provided, by the $BROWSER en‐
              vironment  variable,  or  by  a compile-time default if that is unset
              (usually lynx).  This option implies -t, and will only work with  GNU
              troff.

       -X[dpi], --gxditview[=dpi]
              This  option displays the output of groff in a graphical window using
              the gxditview program.  The dpi (dots per inch)  may  be  75,  75-12,
              100,  or  100-12,  defaulting  to 75; the -12 variants use a 12-point
              base font.  This option implies -T with the  X75,  X75-12,  X100,  or
              X100-12 device respectively.

       -Z, --ditroff
              groff  will  run  troff and then use an appropriate post-processor to
              produce output suitable for the chosen device.  If groff  -mandoc  is
              groff,  this option is passed to groff and will suppress the use of a
              post-processor.  It implies -t.

   Getting help
       -?, --help
              Print a help message and exit.

       --usage
              Print a short usage message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.

EXIT STATUS
       0      Successful program execution.

       1      Usage, syntax or configuration file error.

       2      Operational error.

       3      A child process returned a non-zero exit status.

       16     At least one of  the  pages/files/keywords  didn't  exist  or  wasn't
              matched.

ENVIRONMENT
       MANPATH
              If  $MANPATH is set, its value is used as the path to search for man‐
              ual pages.

       MANROFFOPT
              The contents of $MANROFFOPT are added to the command line every  time
              man invokes the formatter (nroff, troff, or groff).

       MANROFFSEQ
              If $MANROFFSEQ is set, its value is used to determine the set of pre‐
              processors to pass each manual page through.  The default  preproces‐
              sor list is system dependent.

       MANSECT
              If  $MANSECT  is set, its value is a colon-delimited list of sections
              and it is used to determine which manual sections to  search  and  in
              what order.  The default is "1 n l 8 3 2 3posix 3pm 3perl 3am 5 4 9 6
              7", unless overridden by the SECTION directive  in  /etc/manpath.con‐
              fig.

       MANPAGER, PAGER
              If  $MANPAGER or $PAGER is set ($MANPAGER is used in preference), its
              value is used as the name of the program used to display  the  manual
              page.  By default, pager is used, falling back to cat if pager is not
              found or is not executable.

              The value may be a simple command name or a command  with  arguments,
              and  may  use  shell  quoting  (backslashes, single quotes, or double
              quotes).  It may not use pipes to connect multiple commands;  if  you
              need  that,  use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display
              either as an argument or on standard input.

       MANLESS
              If $MANLESS is set, its value will be  used  as  the  default  prompt
              string  for the less pager, as if it had been passed using the -r op‐
              tion (so any occurrences of the text $MAN_PN will be expanded in  the
              same  way).  For example, if you want to set the prompt string uncon‐
              ditionally   to    “my    prompt    string”,    set    $MANLESS    to
              ‘-Psmy prompt string’.   Using  the -r option overrides this environ‐
              ment variable.

       BROWSER
              If $BROWSER is set, its value is a colon-delimited list of  commands,
              each  of  which in turn is used to try to start a web browser for man
              --html.  In each command, %s is replaced by a filename containing the
              HTML  output from groff, %% is replaced by a single percent sign (%),
              and %c is replaced by a colon (:).

       SYSTEM If $SYSTEM is set, it will have the same effect as  if  it  had  been
              specified as the argument to the -m option.

       MANOPT If  $MANOPT is set, it will be parsed prior to man's command line and
              is expected to be in a similar format.  As all of the other man  spe‐
              cific environment variables can be expressed as command line options,
              and are thus candidates for being included in $MANOPT it is  expected
              that  they will become obsolete.  N.B.  All spaces that should be in‐
              terpreted as part of an option's argument must be escaped.

       MANWIDTH
              If $MANWIDTH is set, its value is used as the line length  for  which
              manual  pages  should  be  formatted.  If it is not set, manual pages
              will be formatted with a line length appropriate to the current  ter‐
              minal  (using  the  value  of  $COLUMNS, an ioctl(2) if available, or
              falling back to 80 characters if neither is  available).   Cat  pages
              will  only  be saved when the default formatting can be used, that is
              when the terminal line length is between 66 and 80 characters.

       MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING
              Normally, when output is not being directed to a terminal (such as to
              a  file  or  a  pipe), formatting characters are discarded to make it
              easier to  read  the  result  without  special  tools.   However,  if
              $MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING  is set to any non-empty value, these formatting
              characters are retained.  This may be useful for wrappers around  man
              that can interpret formatting characters.

       MAN_KEEP_STDERR
              Normally,  when  output is being directed to a terminal (usually to a
              pager), any error output from the command used to  produce  formatted
              versions  of  manual pages is discarded to avoid interfering with the
              pager's display.  Programs such as groff often produce relatively mi‐
              nor  error  messages about typographical problems such as poor align‐
              ment, which are unsightly  and  generally  confusing  when  displayed
              along  with  the  manual  page.  However, some users want to see them
              anyway, so, if $MAN_KEEP_STDERR is set to any non-empty value,  error
              output will be displayed as usual.

       LANG, LC_MESSAGES
              Depending  on  system and implementation, either or both of $LANG and
              $LC_MESSAGES will be interrogated for  the  current  message  locale.
              man  will  display  its  messages in that locale (if available).  See
              setlocale(3) for precise details.
